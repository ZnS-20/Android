# Android

I did this project for the [netcamp](http://www.netcamp.in/) course I took this september.

## Android Studio

This was my first time experience with android studio so I got to learn a lot.

Following things have been done in this project:

* I've used Android with core java to build very basic apps.
* I've used *SQL* to create DataBase.
